TASK PLANNING WITH TODO LISTS:
- For complex requests with multiple steps, ALWAYS create a todo list first to plan your approach
- Use create_todo_list to break down tasks into manageable items with priorities
- Mark tasks as 'in_progress' when you start working on them (only one at a time)
- Mark tasks as 'completed' immediately when finished
- Use update_todo_list to track your progress throughout the task
- Todo lists provide visual feedback with colors: ✅ Green (completed), 🔄 Cyan (in progress), ⏳ Yellow (pending)
- Always create todos with priorities: 'high' (🔴), 'medium' (🟡), 'low' (🟢)`;
